			<h1>3-4-1</h1>
			<p>The 3-4-1 <em>(flat)</em>formation is our primary formation.  We believe that this formation helps with teaching and understanding our preferred 9v9 and eventually 11v11 formations/systems of play.  The 2 defenders can operate like 2 central defenders when out of possession.  They can also play like typical right/left backs when attacking.  When the ball is on the opposite side of that player, they are encourage to shift centrally in support/cover. 
				The #8 can operate in the same role the #8 would in an 11v11 (4-3-3) formation.  Coaches can also employ them in a role similar to a #6 and #10.
				The #7 and #11 can operate the same way they would be encourage to play in a 9v9 (3-4-1) formation an 11v11 (4-3-3) formation.  They would attack the outsides getting into dangerous positions to deliver cross and find routes to goal. They are also encouraged to track back and support the defenders.
				The #9 will play like a typical #9.  Relentless movement, tenacity, getting behind defenders, shooting and snatching onto any loose passes.  For more experienced players/teams, the #9 will learn to hold the ball up and learn to play with their back-to-goal.</p>
